# Project Idea 1

Our application displays a gallery of tasty homemade dishes. You can browse the gallery to view the dishes' information and add dishes you like to your favorites list. You can also manage the dishes on your favorites list. Favorites list will be stored locally to allow users to revisit their previously favorited dishes.

Pain points:

- Convienience of choosing meals to prepare

- Easy access recipes for interesting dishes

- Ability to save interesting dishes

# Project Idea 2

Our application would allow the user to manage the inventory of the user's pantry/shopping list. The user could see the inventory for each item and be alerted when to get new items. The user can fully manage their current inventory.

Pain points:

- Convenience for user in tracking daily pantry inventory
